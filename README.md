# Building a wide & deep model with the Keras Functional API

This model takes a wine's description and variety (Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, etc.) as input and predicts the price of the wine. It's built with tf.keras using the Functional Model API and the dataset can be downloaded from :- https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data.
Here's an example input and prediction:

# Inputs
Description: This tremendous 100% varietal wine hails from Oakville and was aged over three years in oak. Juicy red-cherry fruit and a compelling hint of caramel greet the palate, framed by elegant, fine tannins and a subtle minty tone in the background. Balanced and rewarding from start to finish, it has years ahead of it to develop further nuance. Enjoy 2022â€“2030

Variety: Cabernet Sauvignon

# Prediction
Price - $$
